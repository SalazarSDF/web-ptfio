I'm also experienced in styling with CSS, using preprocessors like Sass to keep things organized and maintainable. | Recently, I've been exploring the world of server-side rendering with Next.js, which has opened up new possibilities for building fast and SEO-friendly web applications. I'm excited to continue learning and growing as a frontend developer, and look forward to contributing my skills to future projects.",
